Running at startup
------------------
Created a script at:
/etc/init.d/gaggia

This starts automatically at boot, and stops at shutdown.

Manually start/stop as follows:
sudo /etc/init.d/gaggia start
sudo /etc/init.d/gaggia stop

Binary location
---------------
The binary is located here:
/usr/local/bin/gaggia

Logging
-------
Temperature logs are stored here:
/var/log/gaggia
Files are stored in CSV format.
File names are based on date and time.

Issues
------
* Time/date are incorrect when run from init.d (locale issue?)
* Discontinuous jumps in time stamps (probably due to NTP adjustment)
